1
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:14,82
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

2
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:17,179
Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.

3
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:20,437
Every time he tried to tell her,
something got in the way...

4
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,529
...Iike cats, Italian guys.

5
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,922
And finally, Chandler was,
like, "Forget about her."

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,762
When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

7
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,818
She was, like, "Oh, my God!"

8
00:00:33,61 --> 00:00:35,845
So she went to the airport to meet him.

9
00:00:36,89 --> 00:00:39,710
She didn 't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.

10
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,651
That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

11
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:46,97
But enough about us.
How have you been?

12
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:50,126
The One With Ross' New Girlfriend

13
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:34,331
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

14
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:41,804
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:43,783
Oh, my God!

16
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,64
Excuse me.

17
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,877
Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

18
00:01:48,86 --> 00:01:49,523
Excuse me, excuse me.

19
00:01:58,378 --> 00:01:59,815
There you are!

20
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:05,206
So, so....

21
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:08,226
How was China? You!

22
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,942
It was great.

23
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,115
What happened?

24
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:13,815
-You're bleeding.
-I am?

25
00:02:14,64 --> 00:02:15,934
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

26
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,618
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

27
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:22,602
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

28
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,654
Well, where do I start?

29
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,815
This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

30
00:02:35,15 --> 00:02:35,881
These are....

31
00:02:36,87 --> 00:02:37,180
These are...

32
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,555
...aren't for you.

33
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:41,749
These are for you.

34
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,894
Welcome to our country.

35
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:50,259
Thank you. I'm from New York.

36
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:55,315
No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

37
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,409
Baggage claim?

38
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:11,29
I'm telling U.She went to the airport, 
and she's gonna go for it with Ross.

39
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,839
Oh, my God! This is huge!

40
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:17,718
This is bigger than huge.
This is....

41
00:03:18,32 --> 00:03:20,227
All right, what's bigger than huge?

42
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,44
This?

43
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,180
Guys, you got new haircuts!

44
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,494
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

45
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,245
Because, you know, "lf you don't
look good, we don't look good."

46
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:36,219
I love that voice!

47
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:41,558
And the winner is Eva Godna!

48
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,48
Airport. Airport. Ross.

49
00:03:48,11 --> 00:03:48,653
Not alone.

50
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:49,897
Julie.

51
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,281
Arm around her!

52
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:56,230
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

53
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,20
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

54
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,216
Quick, get the verbs.

55
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,621
You! You!

56
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,856
You said he liked me!

57
00:04:06,99 --> 00:04:07,58
You!

58
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,685
You slowpokes!

59
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:12,513
That's all right.
We got the bags.

60
00:04:16,91 --> 00:04:17,843
This is my sister, Monica.

61
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,845
This is Chandler.

62
00:04:20,57 --> 00:04:21,106
Phoebe, hi.

63
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,400
Joey.

64
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,901
Everyone, this is Julie.

65
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,04
Julie.

66
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:35,233
But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

67
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:39,365
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

68
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,756
-And bus.
-Oh, my God!

69
00:04:42,05 --> 00:04:44,86
-With the screaming guy
-And the spitting.

70
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,884
You gotta hear this story.

71
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,490
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

72
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:49,985
Two hundred, at least.

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,55
And the chicken poops in her lap!

74
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:01,13
I'm so sorry.

75
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,339
I just gave away the ending, didn't l?

76
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:05,878
I just heard this story in the cab...

77
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:09,804
...and it is all I can think about.

78
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:13,639
This is amazing.

79
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,295
How did this happen?

80
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,130
We were in grad school together.

81
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:21,631
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

82
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,730
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

83
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,58
Julie!

84
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:28,127
Isn't that great?

85
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:33,282
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

86
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:36,375
It's an expression.

87
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:40,549
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

88
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:43,445
-Then we'll see the baby.
-Then get some sleep.

89
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,618
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

90
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:49,180
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

91
00:05:54,50 --> 00:05:55,301
Bye!

92
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,938
-Can I get some coffee?
-Sure.

93
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:11,413
-Did you talk to him yet?
-No.

94
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:13,20
Then, no.

95
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,438
What the hell happened to you in China?

96
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,693
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

97
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:32,647
I know I was.

98
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:35,863
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

99
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:40,277
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

100
00:06:41,25 --> 00:06:42,100
God?

101
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,974
It was you, pal.

102
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,720
Maybe it was God doing me.

103
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,523
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

104
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:59,621
And then I met Julie...

105
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,485
...and we're having a great time.

106
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,675
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

107
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,843
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

108
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:12,568
Your lemonade.

109
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,830
I didn't order it.

110
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,659
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

111
00:07:19,11 --> 00:07:21,429
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

112
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:25,623
So what did you find out?

113
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:27,788
He said....

114
00:07:28,67 --> 00:07:29,545
He said....

115
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,373
They're having a great time.

116
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,702
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,396
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

118
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:43,466
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

119
00:07:44,43 --> 00:07:47,52
...without any outside help whatsoever.

120
00:07:48,89 --> 00:07:50,482
How is that a silver lining?

121
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,440
You have to really wanna see it.

122
00:07:59,32 --> 00:08:02,88
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

123
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,61
Hey, Pheebs.

124
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,993
You know what I'm thinking?

125
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,132
How...

126
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:16,446
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

127
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:19,567
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

128
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:27,30
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

129
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,832
So what were you thinking?

130
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:35,570
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

131
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:36,761
No.

132
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:38,500
Why not?

133
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,862
Because I'm just....

134
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,196
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

135
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,336
No, you're not.

136
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,426
I know I'm not, but you are.

137
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:52,140
I was trying to spare your feelings.

138
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,269
Hold on.

139
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,466
Ross, Julie for you.

140
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,712
Anybody know a good tailor?

141
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,399
You need clothes altered?

142
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:35,39
No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

143
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,91
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

144
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,231
He did my first suit when I was 1 5.

145
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:43,910
No, wait, 1 6.

146
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:47,894
No, excuse me, 1 5.

147
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:51,334
All right, when was 1 990?

148
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,806
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

149
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,547
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

150
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,967
Okay, bye.

151
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,827
That is so sweet.

152
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:19,744
Okay. No, you hang up.

153
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,232
No, you

154
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,29
One, two, three.

155
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:29,428
You didn't hang up either.

156
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,639
She didn't hang up.

157
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,629
No, you hang up.

158
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,223
You. You.

159
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,888
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

160
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,378
Rachel.

161
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,174
I'll just call her back.

162
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:02,370
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

163
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,292
No, you hang up.

164
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:05,718
How did this happen to me?

165
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:09,335
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

166
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,840
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

167
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,889
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

168
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,169
...this really great guy
that I can't have.

169
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,762
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

170
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,328
I know you did.

171
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:31,510
I'm just gonna deal with it.

172
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,612
I gotta get out of here!

173
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,102
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

174
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,526
You know, I think I was 1 6.

175
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,351
Please, just a little bit off the back.

176
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:01,865
I'm still on "no."

177
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:05,156
Morning.

178
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,255
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

179
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:11,603
No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

180
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:14,698
What's going on?

181
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:17,130
I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

182
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,108
What stupid thing did you do?

183
00:12:26,57 --> 00:12:27,993
Why don't you just go get dressed...

184
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:31,603
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

185
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:35,426
How did this happen?

186
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:37,902
I kind of ran into him last night.

187
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,413
-Where?
-At his apartment.

188
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,148
Is this juice?

189
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:45,535
And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

190
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:48,946
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

191
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:52,289
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

192
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,839
People do stupid things
when they're upset.

193
00:12:55,52 --> 00:12:58,148
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't

194
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,838
But this is about your horrible mistake.

195
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:10,637
Sorry we're late.

196
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,203
We were....

197
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,410
Well, there was touching.

198
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,252
Hey, Ross!

199
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:24,258
What a....

200
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,773
What are you doing here?

201
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:28,940
I do Raquel!

202
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,974
So he's back?

203
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,746
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

204
00:13:41,33 --> 00:13:42,429
No, not a problem.

205
00:13:43,76 --> 00:13:44,871
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

206
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:48,519
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

207
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,76
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

208
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,148
... my pants need to be altered.

209
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:01,806
When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

210
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:03,771
He'll know what it means.

211
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,927
You sure he'll crack that code?

212
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,215
It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

213
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,330
All right.

214
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,716
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

215
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,915
...and all Monica about it.

216
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,428
I promise.

217
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,201
All right, let's see.

218
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:32,690
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

219
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,31
But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

220
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:52,268
-That's it. I quit.
-What? I didn't say anything!

221
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:56,405
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

222
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,934
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

223
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,341
...doesn't trust a person.

224
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:04,999
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

225
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:08,833
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

226
00:15:09,68 --> 00:15:12,531
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

227
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,351
This is how he wears it.

228
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:18,501
How who wears it?

229
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:19,896
Demi Moore.

230
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,944
Demi Moore is not a "he."

231
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:25,792
Well, he was a "he"
in Arthur and in 10.

232
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,362
That's Dudley Moore!

233
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,697
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

234
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:36,25
Oh, my God!

235
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,230
Oh, God!

236
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:41,426
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

237
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:42,413
Which one is Demi Moore?

238
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:48,93
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

239
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,631
She's got gorgeous hair.

240
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,507
I know!

241
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,137
How long do you want the cuffs?

242
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,885
At least as long as I have the pants.

243
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,24
I just got that.

244
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,536
Now we'll do your inseam.

245
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:43,355
How is she?

246
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,610
It's too soon to tell.

247
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:50,219
She's resting, which is a good sign.

248
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,409
How's the hair?

249
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,914
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

250
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:10,346
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

251
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,341
Can we see her?

252
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,03
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

253
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,669
Ross, you come on in.

254
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,960
Well, how you doing?

255
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:27,956
I'm okay.

256
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:29,188
That bad, huh?

257
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:34,273
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

258
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:36,01
It's one of my gifts.

259
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:45,25
Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

260
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:48,159
...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

261
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:52,20
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

262
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,250
... 50 feet of crap...

263
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:55,847
...then me.

264
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:58,768
Tell Ross how you feel.

265
00:17:59,14 --> 00:18:02,62
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

266
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:05,231
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

267
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:08,586
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

268
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,921
I don't know. I don't know.

269
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,546
I've been with my share of women.

270
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,145
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

271
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:20,802
But the point is...

272
00:18:21,45 --> 00:18:24,969
... I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

273
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:28,559
Really?

274
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:36,909
Yo, paisan!

275
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,599
Can I talk to you for a sec?

276
00:18:45,73 --> 00:18:46,590
Your tailor...

277
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,160
...is a very bad man!

278
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,815
What are you talking about?

279
00:18:53,28 --> 00:18:54,919
Hey, what's going on?

280
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,175
Joey's tailor...

281
00:19:05,08 --> 00:19:06,559
...took advantage of me.

282
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:12,251
No way! I've been going
to the guy for 1 2 years.

283
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,479
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

284
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:18,443
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite

285
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:19,612
What?

286
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,169
Cupping.

287
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,795
That's how they do pants!

288
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,849
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

289
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:36,180
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

290
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:42,04
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

291
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,265
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

292
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:53,394
What's the matter with you?

293
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,647
What?

294
00:19:58,223 --> 00:19:59,82
That's not?

295
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:06,804
Oh, my God!

296
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:22,546
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

297
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,28
I like it.

298
00:20:34,58 --> 00:20:35,529
I do. I think it's a 10!

299
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,49
Thank you.

300
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,794
My hair is very amused.

301
00:20:42,07 --> 00:20:44,635
Come on, things could be worse.

302
00:20:45,74 --> 00:20:48,199
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

303
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,24
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

304
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,340
Thank you.

305
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,750
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

306
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,68
Bye, Rach!

307
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,882
Wait, are you leaving?

308
00:21:02,92 --> 00:21:03,899
That's what I meant by "bye."

309
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,828
Can I talk to you for a sec?

310
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:13,754
When the doctor does
that hernia test....

311
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,996
That's okay.

312
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,141
What's going on?

313
00:21:30,45 --> 00:21:33,279
Well, okay, first of all...

314
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,427
... Paolo and I are not back together.

315
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:38,710
That was a stupid thing I did.

316
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,800
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

317
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,187
...well, I wouldn't.

318
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,529
Second of all....

319
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,350
What?

320
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:57,141
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

321
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,868
... I tell you what I think...

322
00:21:59,80 --> 00:22:01,524
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

323
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,06
...and I look like
a complete idiot?

324
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,407
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

325
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:12,989
I hate him. I mean, I actually
I physically hate him.

326
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:15,598
I always have.

327
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:19,687
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

328
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,574
Really?

329
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:25,84
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

330
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:27,242
...and who gets how funny...

331
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,986
...and sweet and amazing...

332
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,198
...and adorable and sexy you are.

333
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:37,45
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

334
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,997
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

335
00:22:41,73 --> 00:22:43,878
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

336
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:46,257
Like the way I do with Julie.

337
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:54,422
Was there a "second of all"?

338
00:23:00,62 --> 00:23:03,229
No, I think that was the whole "all."

339
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:07,579
I gotta go.

340
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:12,853
Thanks.

341
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,932
No, I swear to God, Dad!

342
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:22,398
That's not how they measure pants!

343
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:32,433
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

344
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:35,116
-Yeah, I could do that.
-Really?

345
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,119
-You wanna do it now?
-Great!

346
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:40,897
See you.

347
00:23:42,77 --> 00:23:44,777
I just wanna make
really sure this time.

348
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:49,396
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

349
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,458
No.

350
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:57,349
That's Roddy McDowall.

351
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:01,360
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

352
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,316
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
